## Getting Started

Gympass design-system's follows design guidelines specification, we developed a React and React Native UI library that contains a set of high quality components that defines our interfaces.

An important note is that the **styled-components** is a peerDependency ([see why])(https://styled-components.com/docs/faqs#i-am-a-library-author-should-i-bundle-styledcomponents-with-my-library), if you dont have styled-components installed you'll [need to install](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics#installation).

### Installing

In order to install our design-system just run:

```bash type=highlight
yarn add @gympass/yoga

// or

npm install @gympass/yoga
```

### Usage

An important point in using it is that your whole application must be wrapped in our `ThemeProvider` component:

```javascript type=highlight
import { ThemeProvider, Button } from '@gympass/yoga';

const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider>
    <Button>Find an activity</Button>
  </ThemeProvider>
);
```
