### Reference

Gympass `<Checkbox />` component implements all our design guidelines such as default spacings, borders and color pallete tokens.
Switches are best used for communicating activation (e.g., on/off states), while checkboxes are best used for communicating selection (e.g., multiple table rows). Switches, unlike checkboxes, can't have an error state.

### Usage

<ExpoSnack id="@gympass/yoga-checkbox" theme="light" />

### Props

<PropsTable component="Checkbox" platform="native" />
