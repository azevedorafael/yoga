# Grid

## Container

Containers provide a means to center and horizontally pad your site’s contents.
Use `<Container />` for a centered container _with margins_ around or
`<Container-fluid />` for a 100% width _without margins_ across all viewport and
device sizes.

```
<Container>
  ...
</Container>

// or

<Container fluid>
...
</Container>
```

## Row

Rows are wrappers for columns. Each column has horizontal padding (called a
gutter) for controlling the space between them.

## Col

`<Col />` indicate the number of columns you’d like to use out of the possible
12 per row. So, if you want three equal-width columns across, you can use
`<Col xxs={4} />`.
