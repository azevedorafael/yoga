# ThemeProvider

### Reference

ThemeProvider component extends from styled-component `ThemeProvider`, you can
check it out [here.](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#theming)
Our component adds some extra features to `ThemeProvider` like global and
specific locale design-tokens merge.

### Usage

An important point in using it is that your whole application **must** be
wrapped in our `ThemeProvider` component:

```
import { ThemeProvider, Button } from '@gympass/yoga';

const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider>
    <Button>Find an activity</Button>
  </ThemeProvider>
);
```

### Props

In this component we have 2 props, both are very important. The first one is the
very known `theme` prop from type `string`.

In this prop you can pass one of our 3 available themes:

- `EndUser`
- `Corporate`
- `Gyms`

These themes apply all global branding rules merging them with culture rules of
and specific locale like `zh-cn` (china) for instance, but for this to happen
We have to combine `theme` prop with the optional `locale` prop, from type
`string` as well.

Although Yoga supports `locale`, we don't have any design definitions for
specific locale design-tokens yet, so the `ThemeProvider` components only uses
global theming for now.
