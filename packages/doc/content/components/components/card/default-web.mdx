### Reference

Gympass `<Card />` component can be used to display content related to a single
subject. The content can consist of multiple elements of varying types and
sizes.

As it could be seen in most components, the Card has its own compounds:

- `<Card.Header />`
- `<Card.Content />`
- `<Card.Actions />`

Also, the Card has the `variant` prop, which reflects the colors provided by our
theme (primary, secondary, and tertiary), you can change the intensity of variant
color with the `variantIntensity` prop, on which it is based on
[colors tokens](https://gympass.github.io/yoga/guidelines/tokens/colors).

### Usage

```javascript reactLive=true center=true
<Card style={{ width: 500 }} ribbon={{ text: 'Add a Ribbon, if you want' }}>
  <Card.Header>
    <h1>Hello,</h1>
  </Card.Header>
  <Card.Content>
    <p>This is a Card component, you can use it to display a content.</p>
  </Card.Content>
  <Card.Actions>
    <Button.Link>You can add actions as well</Button.Link>
  </Card.Actions>
</Card>
```
