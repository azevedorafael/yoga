## Elevations

Elevation is the relative distance between two surfaces along the z-axis.
It brings additional hierarchy to the design and is used mainly to emphasise
interaction states. Elevation is represented with shadows cast by surfaces.
Shadows can be either one-color only (shades of grey with variable opacity) or,
in special cases (like images) it can mimic the image content (see streaming
app light theme templates).
