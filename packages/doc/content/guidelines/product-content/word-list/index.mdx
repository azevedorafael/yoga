## Word list

Some words can be tricky. Take a look down here on how to write them.

- check-in (noun, adjective), check in (verb)
- email (never hyphenate in English, but always do in all other languages,
  and never capitalize, unless it begins a sentence)
- free (never capitalize unless it begins a sentence or appears on a button
  that has directly to do with conversion)
- login (noun, adjective), log in (verb)
- signup (noun, adjective), sign up (verb)
- information (singular and plural)
- search box (never searchbox)
- checkbox (never check box)
- geolocation (not geo-location or geo location)
- internet (never capitalize unless it begins a sentence)
- OK (itâ€™s the correct way to write it, but okay is also acceptable in more
  informal situations)
- online (never capitalize unless it begins a sentence)
- username (not user-name)
- app (never capitalize unless it begins a sentence)

### Terms we like

- **Physical activity** - we want to talk about more than exercising, it is all
  about what makes people move.
- **Gyms, studios and outdoor activities** - we offer all kinds of activities,
  so let's mention that we are more than gyms whenever possible.
- **Smiles, friends, fun, happiness** - the opposite of associating exercising
  to becoming stronger, we want to make it about pleasant experiences with
  friends, about having fun.
- **Try, give a chance to, maybe you will like** - When we invite someone, we
  don't challenge them, we don't push them.

### Terms to avoid

- **Exercise, working out** - We are trying to make people think about physical
  activities in a new way and this is too close to the fitness world we want to
  step away from.
- **Get in shape, summer body, fit, fitness** - this is pure pressure: it shames
  people for their bodies, it makes them feel like they don't belong, it is all we
  DON'T want.
- **No pain no gain, go big or go home, WOD** - this is all fitness lingo, and
  is what generally makes people feel unwelcomed.
- **Challenge, push limits, go beyond** - we approach the fitness world in a
  lighter mood, and will always be aware not to pressure users.
