## Writing for translation

Gympass serves lots of users in different countries. As our user base grows, it
becomes more and more important that our content is easy to understand for
international audiences, including translators.

### Basics

It's easier for a translator to clearly communicate ideas written in
uncomplicated sentences.

When writing for international audiences:

- **Use active voice.** It's important when writing for translation to
  facilitate the comprehension about the text.
- **Use the subject-verb-object sentence structure.** Although not used by all
  languages, it is a widely recognized format.
- **Use positive words when talking about positive situations.** Say “She did a
  good job, right?" instead of "“Don’t you think she did a great job?”.
- **Do not sacrifice clarity for brevity.** There is no problem if you need to
  repeat or add some words to clarify the meaning of the sentences.
- **Consider cultural differences.** Gympass' voice is conversational and
  informal. However, in some cultures, informal text and some emojis can be
  considered offensive. When possible, talk to the responsible for translations
  about this kind of situation to find the best solution for both.
- **Leave in words like then/a/the/to/that.** It helps to understand.

### Words and mechanics to avoid

- Slangs, and cliches
- Uncommon foreign words
- Unnecessary abbreviations
- Converting one part of speech into another if it isn’t already commonly used
  (use "Send us an email” instead of “message us”)
- Double negatives
- Synonyms in general. Don't use a lot of different words for the same thing in
  a single piece of writing. Instead of mixing it up with “register,” “sign up,”
  “create account,” etc., pick one term and stick with it.
