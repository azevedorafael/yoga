## Web elements

Every piece of content we publish is supported by a number of smaller pieces.
This section lays out our style in regards to these web elements.

### Guidelines

#### Buttons

Buttons should always contain actions to make the next step clear for the user.
The language should be clear and concise. Capitalize only the first word
(exceptions may be applied for English and German).

Standard website buttons include:

- Log in
- Check in (when it's an action "to check in")
- Check-in (when it's a noun and supported by an action verb)
- Sign up for free
- Refer a gym
- Add a family member
- Find gyms
- Book now

#### Checkboxes

Use sentence case for checkboxes.

#### Drop-down menus

Use sentence case for menu names and menu items.

#### Forms

Form titles should clearly and quickly explain the purpose of the form.

Use sentence case for form titles and form fields.

Keep forms as short as possible.

### Links

Provide a link whenever you’re referring to something on an external website.
Use links to point users to relevant content and trusted external resources.

Don’t include preceding articles (a, an, the, our) or punctuation marks when you
link text. For example:

- **Do:** I accept the <u>Terms and Conditions</u>.
- **Don't:** I accept <u>the Terms and Conditions.</u>

Don’t say things like “Click here!” or “Click for more information” or
“Read this.” Write the sentence as you normally would, and link relevant
keywords.

### Titles

Titles organize pages and screens, and guide readers. A title appears at the
beginning of a page or section and briefly describes the content that follows.

Don’t use punctuation in a title unless the title is a question or the title
uses more than one sentence.
