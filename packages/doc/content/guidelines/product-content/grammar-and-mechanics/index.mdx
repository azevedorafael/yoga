## Grammar and mechanics

### Basics

**Write for all readers.** Some people will read everything, others will only
scan. Help everyone read better by grouping related ideas together, avoiding
long blocks of text and using descriptive headers and subheaders.

**Focus your message.** Create a hierarchy of information. Lead with the main
point or the most important content, in sentences, paragraphs, sections, and
pages.

**Be clear, concise, and useful.** Remove the technical terms, use as few words
as possible without losing the meaning, and think, when writing the content,
about the actions the user must take to reach his/her goal.

**Be specific.** Avoid vague language. Cut excesses.

**Be consistent.** Inconsistency creates confusion. Do not use different
terminology for the same purpose. For instance, when you're asking the user to
'book a class', don't change it to 'reserve a class'. This includes the text,
labels, buttons. It's important to have patterns.

## Guidelines

### Active voice

We prefer to avoid passive voice. In active voice, the subject of the sentence
does the action. In passive voice, the subject of the sentence has the action
done to it.

- **Do:** Max used the daily access code.
- **Don't:** The daily access code was used by Max.

Words like “was” and “by” may indicate that you’re writing in passive voice.
Scan for these words and rework sentences where they appear.

An exception is when you want to specifically emphasize the action over the
subject.

- Your suggestion has already been received by our team.

### Capitalization

There are 2 main ways to capitalize words:

- **Title case:** Capitalize every word. This Is Title Case.
- **Sentence case:** Capitalize just the first word. This is sentence case.

For us, sentence case looks more casual and friendly because it is more like how
humans communicate. Writing on the web should be conversational and
approachable, and writing as humans naturally is a good way of doing this.

So we recommend sentence case for almost everything.

- **Do:** Ready to start? Choose your location or use your daily access code.
- **Don't:** Ready to Start? Choose your location or use your daily access code.
- **Don't:** Ready to Start? Choose Your Location or Use Your Daily Access Code.

There are some exceptions to this rule.

1. The text translated into German. In this case, grammatical rules change and
   all the nouns appear in uppercase.
2. When we are talking about Gympass Corporate, Help Center, Smart (of Smart
   check-in) and Premium (of Premium gym). In all of these cases, we apply Title
   Case.

When writing out an email address or website URL, use all lowercase.

- marketing@gympass.com
- gympass.com

We capitalize names of activities in the middle of sentences.

- I love to practice Pilates using Gympass.

But we don't capitalize random words in the middle of sentences. Here are some
of them.

- sign up
- check-in
- location
- internet
- online
- email

### Contractions

Yes, we like it! They give an informal, friendly tone to the content. But when
you need to emphasise the action, do not use it.

Reminder: think carefully about it when writing content that will be translated
for international audience. Contractions that end in ’s can be mistaken for
possessive nouns, and the ’s can be read as either has or is, so only use it
accompanied by it, she or he.

- **Do:** Here is your token.
- **Don't:** Here's your token.

### Emoji

Emoji are a nice way to add humor and visual interest to your writing, but use
them occasionally and deliberately.

| **Emoji we like**                                | **Emoji to avoid**                            |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Happy/Laugh/In love reactions<br />😀😁😉😍      | Sad/Angry/Feeling ill reactions<br />😫😥😡🤢 |
| Congratulations reactions<br />🙌👏👍            | Workout biceps/Fisted hand<br />👊💪          |
| People of different races/colors<br />👩👩🏼👩🏽👩🏾👩🏿 | Ambiguous<br />😏👀🍑🍆                       |
| Physical activities<br />🏂🤸‍♀️🤾‍♀️🧘‍♀️🏊‍♀️🧗‍♀️🚴‍♂️          | Boozes<br />🍷🍺🍸                            |

The examples above are just a guide to what we want to pass on to the user and
what we want to avoid. You are free to think about other options. Just remember
that as we write for different countries, it's important to think about cultural
context when using an emoji: in a country, one reaction can be well received.
In another one, it can have a bad meaning.

### Numbers

We prefer to use the numeral over ordinals.

- We have 5 new gyms at Gympass.
- More than 700 activities.
- Congrats for your 50 check-in.

In English, numbers over 3 digits get commas:

- 999
- 1,000
- 150,000

In other languages, numbers over 3 digits get points:

- 999
- 1.000
- 150.000

### Dates

Generally, spell out the day of the week and the month. Abbreviate only if you
don't have enough space. Do not use contractions (st, th, nd) and do not use
leading zeros on days.

- Saturday, January 24
- Sat, Jan 24

### Percentages

Use the % symbol instead of spelling out "percent".

### Ranges and spans

Use a hyphen (-) without spaces on either side to indicate a range of numbers.

- It takes 20-30 days.

### Money

When writing about currency, use, preferably, the currency sign before the
amount plus the 3-letter abbreviation of the country. Include a decimal number
of cents just if it is more than 0. Decimals should be separated with a comma
for BR, ES, AR, CL, MX, GE, FR, IT, NL, PT. For the other countries
(US, UK, IE), use the dot.

- R\$35,99 (BRL)
- US\$20.50 (USD)
- £45 (GBP)

The € sign for Europe does not need the 3-letter abbreviation, and:

- The symbol should always go after the numbers. Example: 62,99€
- The UK and Ireland are an exception to this rule, respecting the same rule as
  the US, including the rule for decimals. Example: €62.99

If you don't have enough space, we can use the reduced version, with only the
symbol.

- R\$35,99
- US\$20.50
- £45

### Telephone numbers

Use dashes without spaces between numbers, respecting the most common numeric
separation of each country. And use a country and area code if your reader is in
another country.

- 555-867-5309
- +1-404-123-4567
- +55-11-5432-1111

### Time

Don’t use minutes for on-the-hour time, and respect the most common spelling of
hours for each country.

For US and Mexican, content, use numerals and am or pm, with a colon in between.

- 8 am
- 8:30 pm

For BR and FR content, use 24-hour clock, with 'h' between numbers.

- 19h30

For DE content, employ 24-hour clock, and use numerals and Uhr, with a colon in
between.

- 5 Uhr
- 19:30 Uhr

For NL content, employ 24-hour clock, and use numerals and uur, with a colon in
between.

For all the other countries, employ 24-hour clock, and use numerals, with a
colon in between.

- 19:30
- 09:00

In text, use _to_ in a range of times.

- 10 am to 11 pm

In a schedule or list, use a hyphen between times to indicate a time period. No
"from" and no spaces around it.

- 8 am-11:30 pm
- 09:00-11:30

### Punctuation

#### Commas

When writing a list, use the serial comma. In a list of 3 or more, include a
comma before the conjunction.

- **Do:** Last month we did Yoga, Crossfit, and Pilates.
- **Don't:** Last month we did Yoga, Crossfit and Pilates.

When it's a list, don't use commas, semicolon or periods.

- **Do:**

  - Yoga
  - Crossfit
  - Pilates

- **Don't:**
  - Yoga;
  - Crossfit;
  - Pilates.

#### Hyphens

Use a hyphen (-) without spaces on either side to link words into single phrase,
or to indicate a span or range.

- 1st-time user
- Monday-Friday

#### Periods

We don't use periods in titles or buttons.

#### Exclamation points

Use exclamation points casually, and never more than one at a time. They aren't
a substitute for creating excitement, and too many can be really annoying.

Never use exclamation points in failure messages or alerts. When in doubt, avoid
it!

### Activities, places, and things

#### Names

Capitalize the names of activities.

- Zumba, Functional, Indoor Cycling

#### States, cities, and countries

Don’t abbreviate city names.

For countries and states, it's ok. You can use the common abbreviation like US
for United States, UK for United Kingdom, BR for Brazil, SP for São Paulo, NY
for New York.

### Writing about Gympass

Always capitalize the first “G” and lowercase the “p” in Gympass.

Refer to Gympass as “we,” not “it”.

### Text formatting

To think about text formatting, it's very important to consider the context and
the function of the message.

- **Messages with aspirational appeal.** Use italics to highlight the more
  important part of the copy.

  - **Find an activity** _to love_.

- **Massive text and messages with instructional appeal.** Use bold to highlight
  the more important part of the copy, and to determine hierarchy on the page.

  - Title: **Your company doesn't offer Gympass Corporate?**
  - Subtitle: **Get special discounts** referring your company.
  - Button: Refer company

- **When citing an example of an in-app Gympass element, or referencing a button
  and navigation labels in a step-by-step instructions**. In this case, use
  italics.
  - When you're all done, click _Send_.

Never use underline formatting.

### Avoid to overcommunicate when calling for attention

Focus the attention call within the message or in the layout. Writing more than
necessary is not functional. Focus on what really matters so that the message is
transmitted in a useful and clear way.

- **Do:** You forgot to complete this field.
- **Don't:** Attention! You need to fill this field below with your Employee ID.

### Write positively

Use positive language rather than negative language. One way to detect negative
language is to look for words like “can’t”, “don’t”, etc.

- **Do:** Check-in is available once a day.
- **Don't:** You can’t check in more than once a day.
