## Grammar and mechanics

### Basics

**Write for all readers.** Some people will read everything, others will only
scan. Help everyone read better by grouping related ideas together, avoiding
long blocks of text and using descriptive headers and subheaders.

**Focus your message.** Create a hierarchy of information. Lead with the main
point or the most important content, in sentences, paragraphs, sections, and
pages.

**Be clear, concise, and useful.** Remove the technical terms, use as few words
as possible without losing the meaning, and think, when writing the content,
about the actions the user must take to reach his/her goal.

**Be specific.** Avoid vague language. Cut excesses.

**Be consistent.** Inconsistency creates confusion. Do not use different
terminology for the same purpose. For instance, when you're asking the user to
'book a class', don't change it to 'reserve a class'. This includes the text,
labels, buttons. It's important to have patterns.

## Guidelines

### Active voice

We prefer to avoid passive voice. In active voice, the subject of the sentence
does the action. In passive voice, the subject of the sentence has the action
done to it.

- **Do:** Max used the daily access code.
- **Don't:** The daily access code was used by Max.

Words like “was” and “by” may indicate that you’re writing in passive voice.
Scan for these words and rework sentences where they appear.

An exception is when you want to specifically emphasize the action over the
subject.

### Capitalization

There are 2 main ways to capitalize words:

- **Title case:** Capitalize every word. This Is Title Case.
- **Sentence case:** Capitalize just the first word. This is sentence case.

For us, sentence case looks more casual and friendly because it is more like how
humans communicate. Writing on the web should be conversational and
approachable, and writing as humans naturally is a good way of doing this.

So we recommend sentence case for almost everything.

- **Do:** Ready to start? Choose your location or use your daily access code.
- **Don't:** Ready to Start? Choose your location or use your daily access code.
- **Don't:** Ready to Start? Choose Your Location or Use Your Daily Access Code.

There are some exceptions to this rule.

1. The text translated into German. In this case, grammatical rules change and
   all the nouns appear in uppercase.
2. When we are talking about Gympass Corporate, Help Center, Smart (of Smart
   check-in) and Premium (of Premium gym). In all of these cases, we apply Title
   Case.

When writing out an email address or website URL, use all lowercase.

- marketing@gympass.com
- gympass.com

We capitalize names of activities in the middle of sentences.

- I love to practice Pilates using Gympass.

But we don't capitalize random words in the middle of sentences. Here are some
of them.

- sign up
- check-in
- location
- internet
- online
- email

### Contractions

Yes, we like it! They give an informal, friendly tone to the content. But when
you need to emphasise the action, do not use it.

Reminder: think carefully about it when writing content that will be translated
for international audience. Contractions that end in ’s can be mistaken for
possessive nouns, and the ’s can be read as either has or is, so only use it
accompanied by it, she or he.

- **Do:** Here is your token.
- **Don't:** Here's your token.
