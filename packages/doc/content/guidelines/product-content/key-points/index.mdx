## Key points

The Gympass Content Style Guide goes into depth on many subjects. Here are the
most important things to know.

### Principles

Good content is:

- Clear
- Concise
- Useful
- Friendly
- Appropriate

### Voice and tone

Gympass' voice is:

- Human
- Empathic
- Friendly
- Welcoming
- Undemanding
- Positive

Our tone changes depending on the public and situation, but it's generally
informal. We have a sense of humor, but we value clarity over entertainment.

Our main goal with all copy is to make users feel like physical activities are
for everyone, corporations feel like they can change the lives of their
employees, and fitness partners can find a partner to help them grow, all
without standardizing or confusing them.

### Writing about people

We write with a person-first perspective. Whether you’re writing for an
end-user, a gym or a corporate client, it's important to write for and about
other people in a way that’s compassionate, inclusive, and respectful.

- Don’t refer to people using age-related descriptors like “young,” “old,” or
  “elderly.” For us, everybody is a protagonist and has the same importance.
- Avoid gendered terms, we are in favor of neutral alternatives.

### Grammar and mechanics

- Some people will read every word you write. Others will just scan. Help
  everyone by grouping related ideas together and using descriptive headers
  and subheaders.
- Focus your message, and create a hierarchy of information.
- Use active voice and positive language.
- Avoid vague or technical language, and use simple words and sentences.
- Write thinking about the actions the user must take to reach his/her goal.
- Use sentence case to make our product looks more casual and friendly.
- Be consistent. Adhere to the copy patterns and style points outlined in this
  guide.
- Feel free to use emoji, but use them occasionally and deliberately. Remember
  that there are some of them that don't have anything to do with us.
- Always capitalize the first “G” and lowercase the “p” in Gympass.
- Use exclamation points casually, and never more than one at a time. When in
  doubt, avoid.
- Don’t use underline, and consider the context and the function of the message
  when using bold or italics.

### Web elements

- Organize your page around one topic.
- Don’t use punctuation in a title unless the title is a question or the title
  uses more than one sentence.
- Use only sentence case (exceptions may be applied for English and German),
  including for checkboxes, drop-down menus, forms, and buttons.
- Keep forms as short as possible. Only request information that we need and
  intend to use. Don’t ask for irrelevant personal information, like gender.
- Don’t include preceding articles (a, an, the, our) or punctuation marks when
  linking a text.
- Don’t say things like “Click here!” or “Click for more information” or “Read
  this.” Instead, link relevant keywords.
- Use clear, descriptive terms that relate to the topic of the page.
- Buttons should always contain actions. The language should be clear and
  concise.

### Writing for accessibility

- Create a hierarchy, with the most important information first.
- Place similar topics in the same paragraph, and clearly separate different
  topics with headings.
- Use plain language. Write short sentences and familiar words.
- Links should provide information on the associated action or destination.
  Avoid saying “click here” or “learn more.”
- Evaluate the necessity of using images when the same information could be
  communicated in writing.
- Avoid directional instructions or language that requires the reader to see the
  layout or design of the page.
- Label inputs on forms with clear names and use appropriate tags. Think
  carefully about which fields are necessary, and especially which ones you mark
  as required.
- Avoid big scrolls.
- Give every image a textual equivalent.

### Writing for translation

- Use active voice.
- Avoid double negatives, and use positive words.
- Leave in words like then/a/the/to/that. It helps to understand.
- Avoid using synonyms for the same word in a single piece of writing.
- Write briefly, but don’t sacrifice clarity for brevity. There is no problem if
  you need to repeat or add some words to clarify the meaning of the sentences.
- Avoid slangs and cliches.
- Avoid unnecessary abbreviations.
