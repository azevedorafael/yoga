## Voice and tone

Gympass needs to be perceived like Gympass all the time. So, we have to be aware
of our voice and tone.
To understand the difference between both, think of it this way: you have the
same voice all the time, but your tone changes. You might use a tone when you're
in a party with your friends, and a different one when you're in a conference
with your boss.

Your tone also changes depending on the emotional state of the person you’re
talking to. You wouldn’t address the same way to someone who is angry and
someone who is excited.

The same is true for Gympass. Our voice doesn’t change much from day to day, but
our tone always does.

### Voice

At Gympass, we talk like a person who has recently discovered a passion for a
physical activity and now encourages everyone to try the same feeling. No
pressure, just friendship.

We are empathic. We don't focus on performance, we understand that every workout
is a step in the right direction.

Besides that, we truly know that Gympass is a difficult product to understand,
so we treat the language as an instructional tool by using a conversational
voice.

When we write:

- **We are positive instead.** We always look at things in a positive way, and
  make the conversation about physical activity as enjoyable as possible.
- **We are welcoming.** We are here to welcome everyone willing to join. And we
  express it through our language, making it simple.
- **We are inclusive.** We believe everyone can find an activity to love. Our
  communication leaves no doubt about it: we want everyone here.
- **We are undemanding.** We are zero into 'no pain no gain', we are not 'going
  big or going home'. We don't ask too much of anyone, we don't shame. We
  encourage each new attempt.

### Tone

Gympass' tone is usually informal, but it’s always more important to be clear
than entertaining. When writing, consider the public you are talking:

- **End-user.** Employees of partner corporations who go to our partner
  facilities, experience our app, and try new activities. The people we
  encourage daily to defeat inactivity and celebrate at each check-in.
- **Gyms.** Full service gyms, studios, and other fitness providers who become
  Gympass partners. We work to make this the best partnership possible by
  creating better integrations, providing user information and whatever else is
  needed to make the partnership productive.
- **Corporate.** Companies that offer Gympass as a corporate benefit to their
  employees. Usually, it's with the HR of these companies that we talk to and
  negotiate the plans.

It seems easy to notice that these 3 reader's state of mind are different,
right? When talking to them, remember this:
